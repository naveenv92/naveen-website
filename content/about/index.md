I am currently working as a machine learning software engineer at [**Rivian**](https://www.rivian.com), building applications to leverage generative AI. For the 3 years prior, I was a data scientist in the quality and reliability engineering departments, working on vehicle insights and using prognostics to guide proactive maintenance.

Before my industrial career, I was a PhD student in the [**Chabinyc Group**](https://labs.materials.ucsb.edu/chabinyc/michael/) at UC Santa Barbara, where I researched hybrid perovksites as an absorber material for solar cells and photodetectors.
