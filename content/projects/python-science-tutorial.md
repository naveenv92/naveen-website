During my graduate school studies, I realized how powerful the visualization packages in python could be in creating extremely customizable figures for my publications. I also became a huge evangelist and advocate of using open source tools such as `numpy` and `scipy` compared to commercial offerings like MATLAB to do data analysis. I also generate all data visualizations for my pubcliations with `matplotlib`. Through these years, I accumulated a lot of specific knowledge about formatting figures and generating scientific publication-quality figures. So, as we were stuck in COVID lockdown, I decided to document some of my learnings, partially as a exercise for myself to keep them handy for the future. My initial article about an introduction in to scientific publication figures with python was accepted into Towards Data Science on Medium and, since then, I started putting together a series of tutorials and sample code on GitHub.
